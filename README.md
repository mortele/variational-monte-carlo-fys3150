Solves project 3 of FYS3150 (autumn 2014), more or less...

Uses a Variational Monte Carlo method employing the Metropolis algorithm in order to calculate the ground state energies of various quantum systems.

Currently tailored for two-dimensional quantum dots (harmonic oscillator-like potentials), with Coulomb interaction.
